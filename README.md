# Python-Operators
In this file I'm explaining Python Operators: 

Arthematic Operator (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=)
Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
Logical Operators (and, or, not)
Identity Operators (is, is not)
Membership Operators (in, not in)
Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)

in a very simple way so Learn and enjoy the code.
